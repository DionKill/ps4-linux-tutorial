In this very professional tutorial, I'll go over how to install Linux on your PS4. I've made this because the PS4Linux.com website hasn't been updated in ages and their documentation is pretty bad (still, I appreciate their work, this guide is heavily inspired by it). This tutorial focuses ONLY on modern versions of Linux.

## Quick Q&A
<details>
  <summary>Questions you probably have</summary>

### Oh my god! Linux? Eww!
- ???
### What? Installing? I knew it. You are just a ragebaiter who wants to ERASE my precious PS4's HDD! How dare you!
-  Erm actually... It doesn't. It creates a huge file that contains your whole installation (only for internal HDD installation). You can obviously still use your PS4 normally- also you need to boot to the "normal homescreen" aka OrbisOS to launch Linux.
- You can also use an external drive and it'll work wonders (DO NOT use a USB stick or HDD if you want to keep your sanity) and it won't take up space on your preciously dying hard drive :3
### This shit doesn't work. You're a liar!
- Honestly I wish I could help you out. If the tutorial doesn't work, try asking for help on the [PS4Linux forums](ps4linux.com/forums/) or their Discord server.
### How does it run?
- This is a good question. On an external SSD, it's really usable. Though the CPU is a huge limiting factor.
### Can I play my PC games on Linux?
- Of course. That's the whole point of doing this, no?
- Not all games will run though. Set your expectations low.
### But... How does it work?
- I have no idea. Judging by how the PS4 reacts, I'm assuming it gets tricked into going into sleep mode, and then resumes immediately which wakes up the console with it's OS erased from memory and only the Linux kernel loaded. This is just speculation though, because I like to spread misinformation on the internet and can't be bothered to do my homework. Oh, and I use arch btw (only on PS4).
### I have encountered issues and want to help out. Can I make an issue so the guide can be updated?
- Yes! Please do not gatekeep information!
