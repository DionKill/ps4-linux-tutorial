    details: Sony sold 120M+ PS4s. And you're probably not yousing yours. You either modded your PS4 because you weren't using it, or are about to. After installing Linux, you'll be able to play thousands of PC games, including emulators!
  - title: A comprehensive guide!?
    details: The other online guides keep on missing the point. A lot of them either lack information, or are simply bad documented.
