  - title: Give a new purpose to your dusty PS4!
    details: I bet you have a PS4 laying around that you don't know what to do with. Even after modding it, there's very little that makes the PS4 a special console. But you can give it a new life with Linux, and run PC games on it!
  - title: Easy setup
    details: This guide will walk you through every step of the way and will explain to you not just how to install, but also to setup Linux in general, how to maintain it very easily and make it a usable everyday OS- because why not.
  - title: A comprehensive guide
    details: The other online guides keep on missing the point. A lot of them either lack information, or are simply bad documented. This guide is made from the ground up by pure rage because nobody has one that details everything.
