# Key information
In this *very professional* tutorial, we'll go over how to install Linux on your PS4.

This guide was originally made because the PS4Linux.com's guide was old, hard to understand, incomplete and with tons of ads. It was updated recently, but the guide section hasn't really changed.

Still, thanks to noob404 for their website, as this is a better-put-together version of their work. This guide wouldn't exist without it.

::: details Focus of the guide
This tutorial focuses ONLY on modern versions of Linux.

If you need, for some odd reason, old builds of Linux, you can check out the [legacy section](legacy).
:::

::: details What consoles are compatible?
All consoles that can run a homebrew enabler (like GoldHEN or ps4hen) are able to run Linux.

At the time of writing, the newest compatible firmware is 12.02.

However, every console has a different southbridge, and Baikal in particular has many issues. You should be able to get a working installation either way.
