## Credits
### Kernel developers
These are the original kernel developers, who did the hard work to port the kernels on which all of the modern kernels are based on:
- 4.4  kernel
	- marcan, fail0verflow team
- 4.14 kernel
	- rancido, and psxitateam, eeply, valery for Baikal (based on fail0verflow)
- 4.19 and 5.3 kernel
	- mircoho, (based on fail0verflow, psxitateam, eeply, valeryy)
- 5.15 kernel
	- codedwrench (based on fail0verflow, psxitateam, eeply, valeryy, mircoho)
- 6.15 kernel
	- crashniels with 2 patches from mircoho (fastboot and ethernet kp fixes) (based on fail0verflow - psxitateam  - eeply - valeryy - mircoho - codedwrench)

If you want, you can check out their repos:
- [marcan (fail0verflow) ](https://github.com/fail0verflow/ps4-linux)
	- Without them nothing would've ever been possible.
- [rancido (psxitateam)](https://github.com/Ps3itaTeam/ps4-linux/)
	- Made the AMDGPU driver work.
- [eeply](https://github.com/eeply/ps4-linux)
	- Brought PS4 Pro to work for video output, in fact now all ps4 with new Panasonic HDMI chip work.
- valeryy (no GitHub, gave the code to rancido)
	- Brought the Baikal Southbridge support.
- [tihmstar](https://github.com/tihmstar/ps4-linux)
	- Brought the Internal SATA driver for PS4 Belize.
- [mircoho](https://github.com/ps4boot/ps4-linux) ([ps4gentoo](https://github.com/ps4gentoo/ps4-linux-5.3.7) and [ps4boot](https://github.com/ps4boot/))
	- Worked on the kernel (especially Gentoo), ported payloads to newer firmwares.
- [codedwrench](https://github.com/codedwrench/ps4-linux)
	- Made kernel patches.
- [crashniels](https://github.com/crashniels/linux)
	- Ported newer kernel versions.
- [freeRnt](https://github.com/feeRnt/ps4-linux-12xx) (Package)
	- Hosts and maintains the PS4 Linux kernel sources on GitHub.

Additionally, I also want to mention:
- [saya](https://www.youtube.com/@saya7068)
	- For their kernels and tutorials.
- [triki1](https://www.youtube.com/@trakerchris9876)
	- Also for their kernel and tutorials.

Thank you all so much for making this possible.
