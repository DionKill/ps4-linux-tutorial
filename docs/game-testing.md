# Game testing and info on how to get it running
This page is dedicated to testing and reporting ways to get games running on Linux.

## Levels of stability
There's multiple levels of stability:
- Broken
	- The game doesn't work at all
- Low
	- Major graphical glitches ruin the experience, or it just lags like crap
- Medium
	- Some issues here and there, you can still see frequent glitches
- High
	- Works for the most part, only issues in specific place that don't really affect the majority of the game
- Perfect
	- It works with no issues
