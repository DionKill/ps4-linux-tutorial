# Common gotchas

There are a lot of undocumented issues. Or, if they are documented, I couldn't even find them because no search engine indexed those pages or they are in a foreign language.
## Graphical issues
Sometimes you can encounter graphical issues. Screen flickers at boot, or is unresponsive. There can also be weird graphical glitches in menus and even in games, especially Nintendo Switch emulators for what I've seen.

Hell, even Minecraft has issues. I managed to get a stable run only on 1.21.5 using the Vulkan Renderer mod.

Linux on PS4 is using modified AMDGPU drivers that are unfortunately old and unstable or bleeding-edge and unstable. There's nothing you can do about it, unless you know how to work with GPU drivers. Which I don't. I'd say it's a miracle we got this far and honestly, we shouldn't complain that things are a bit unstable.

## Rebooting goes to OrbisOS
I mean it was kind of expected. How else are you gonna go back to the main menu?

## Sometime it just doesn't work
Sometime the exploit fails, or loading the Linux payload crashes the console, or when booting into Linux things don't work and you gotta reboot. Again, things are unstable, it'll take a lot of work and time to fix.

## How can I improve the situation?
I don't know man, my laptop battery is about to die and I wanna stop yapping. Check the links at the start of the guide.
