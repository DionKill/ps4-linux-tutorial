# Port your own distro
If you don't trust people on the internet (and rightfully so), you may want to port a distro of your liking on the PS4. If everything goes according to plan, you should be able to port your own distro without too many problems.

## Requirements
You need to get the **drivers**.

You may find closed-sourced versions of the drivers shared privately on Discord (is that even legal?) but you may want to compile these yourself.

## WIP
Not much info here. I'm not even going to link it yet, I can't find open source drivers so to avoid confrontation with the developers in case of leaks none that are open source will be reported for now.
