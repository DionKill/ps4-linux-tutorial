# Internal HDD installation
Here you'll setup the internal HDD for installation of a Linux distro.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure you are NOT following this on a console with a Baikal southbridge.
> 
> If you proceed, either it won't boot, or you'll inevitably corrupt your whole drive and loose all your data!

> [!WARNING]
> This shit is slow. Be careful and prepare your balls for imminent explosion.


## Internal HDD setup
Check your PS4 storage, as you'll need to choose the size of the installation. Leave some free space in your console, and remember that the PS4 doesn't report the space taken internally by Linux!

FTP to your PS4. Go to the `/data/` folder, and create the folder `/linux/boot/` and place your bzImage (and bootargs.txt if you have it) and initramfs in there.

Then, go to `/user/system/`, create a folder called `boot`, and paste your distro in there. Remember that it needs to be called `psxitarch.tar.gz` or `xz`!

When installed, you can remove your Linux installation by removing the above files, and the "linux.img" found in `/user/home/` folder. Just in case you realize I was correct.

## Installation commands
Now that the storage is covered, here comes the moment of truth. You'll be sent to the Rescue Shell.

> [!TIP]
> If you get an error, go to the [Installation issues section](issues#installation-issues).

Internal HDD
- Type `linux-install-hdd.sh`
- Type how much storage you want to use for the installation (check how much free space you have, don't fill up your drive as the PS4 won't report it!)
	- If it fails, go to the [Installation Issues](issues.md#installation-issues)

Hydrate yourself while you wait. It'll take a while.

You should already boot into the desktop. If it doesn't, run
```bash
resume-boot
```

Go now, conquer the finale. Also, watch the post-credit scenes.
