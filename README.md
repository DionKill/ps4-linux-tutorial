# PS4 Linux Installation Tutorial Repo
This repo hosts the PS4 Linux installation tutorial website.
It's hosted on a simple VitePress website and I'm doing my best at documenting this in a way that doesn't give you a stroke.

You can visit it [here](https://dionkill.github.io/ps4-linux-tutorial/).

## Building the repo
To build the repo, clone the repo, then inside said repo, run the commands you find at the [VitePress quickstart](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started).
