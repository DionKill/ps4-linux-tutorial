# PS4 Linux Installation Tutorial Repo
This repo hosts the PS4 Linux installation tutorial website.
It's hosted on a simple VitePress website (and it took me like 5 hours to make it work)- and I'm doing my best at documenting this in a way that doesn't give you a stroke.

It's very empty right now please don't judge

You can visit it [here](https://dionkill.github.io/ps4-linux-tutorial/).
