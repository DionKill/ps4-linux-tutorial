Just kidding, it&#39;s fucking terrible.</p><p>But don&#39;t worry, cuz I&#39;ve suffered before you (and still am by writing this absolute monstrosity of a guide) so that the only thing you have to do is follow my guide as I spoonfeed you with information.</p><p>I&#39;d recommend reading the following:</p><details><summary>Useful information about Internal/External installation</summary><h2 id="information" tabindex="-1">Information <a class="header-anchor" href="#information" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Information&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As I&#39;ve mentioned beforehand, you can&#39;t install Linux on the internal PS4&#39;s HDD on Baikal systems. I know, you&#39;re crying your heart out because you wanted to use it, but trust me it&#39;s atrocious. To give you an explanation, it took me 30 MINUTES to update my CachyOS installation (500MBs) and the system was so unresponsive that I watched anime in between clicks.</p><p>Therefore, I want to clear some misinformation here:</p><ol><li>The PS4&#39;s internal HDD is a repurposed laptop 5400RPM drive. Please, for the love of GOD, do NOT use this. Even the PS4&#39;s own menus lag because of how slow it is.</li><li>The PS4 internal drive uses UFS encryption so it slows down significantly.</li><li>You CAN clone your PS4 HDD into an SSD, if internal installation is a must for you</li><li>The PS4 doesn&#39;t support TRIM, so a possible internal SSD swap would be a lot slower in writing data (a cached SSD with a garbage collector would be a bit better though, so don&#39;t worry)</li><li>PS4 Phat and Slim are limited to SATA-II, which is 3Gbps in speed (roughly 375MB/s), which people online say it&#39;s not enough (it&#39;s enough for a PS4). On the other hand, the PS4 Pro runs at SATA-III, which is 6Gbps (up to 750MB/s), so that can saturate every SATA SSD on the market. <ol><li>External SSD, on my 500GB Samsung 870 EVO, is 350MB/s-ish. So you&#39;d get the same performance as an internal drive (theoretically)</li></ol></li></ol><p>Again I haven&#39;t tried with an internal SSD swap, so your mileage may vary if you wanna go that route. If you have info on that, let me know.</p></details><p>TLDR: for Internal only Aeolia/Belize. Every console supports external.</p><h3 id="anyways-here-we-go-queue-dream-s-speedrunning-music" tabindex="-1">Anyways, here we go: (queue dream&#39;s speedrunning music) <a class="header-anchor" href="#anyways-here-we-go-queue-dream-s-speedrunning-music" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Anyways, here we go: (queue dream&#39;s speedrunning music)&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li>Boot your PS4 and launch GoldHen.
