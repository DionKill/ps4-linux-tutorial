It creates a huge file that contains your whole installation (only for internal HDD installation). You can obviously still use your PS4 normally- also you need to boot to the &quot;normal homescreen&quot; aka OrbisOS to launch Linux.</li><li>You can also use an external drive and it&#39;ll work wonders (DO NOT use a USB stick or HDD if you want to keep your sanity) and it won&#39;t take up space on your preciously dying hard drive :3</li></ul><h3 id="this-shit-doesn-t-work-you-re-a-liar" tabindex="-1">This shit doesn&#39;t work.

Judging by how the PS4 reacts, I&#39;m assuming it gets tricked into going into sleep mode, and then resumes immediately which wakes up the console with it&#39;s OS erased from memory and only the Linux kernel loaded. This is just speculation though, because I like to spread misinformation on the internet and can&#39;t be bothered to do my homework. Oh, and I use arch btw (only on PS4).</li></ul><h3 id="i-have-encountered-issues-and-want-to-help-out-can-i-make-an-issue-so-the-guide-can-be-updated" tabindex="-1">I have encountered issues and want to help out.
